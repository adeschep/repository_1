# The Big Al

### Geography

I live in the city of TigerTown, in the state of Victoria, in the good old Oz.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Noddy does Big Ears* by Enid Blyton
- *Welcome to the Monkey House* by Kurt Vonnegut
- *Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Maccas in Ashburton.
2. KFC in Jerusalem.
3. Taco Bill in New York City.
